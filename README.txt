This application was created for EECS 285 at the University of Michigan.  This project had no descrtiption, and my group decided to create this android application.  The group was made up of me (Chris O'Neil), Omid Ghomeshi, Josh Sklar, and Joel Zou. This app is made using Parse on the backend.

This application manages tasks within groups.  Users can sign in and create groups and join groups.  Within these groups, users can delegate tasks to members of the group, and then update their status as time goes on.  This is a functionally complete app, and contains all of the necessary error checking and features of a common app on the market.
